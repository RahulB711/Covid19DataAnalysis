# Covid 19 Data Analysis
Data analysis on COVID-19 in India plays a vital role in understanding the dynamics of the pandemic, guiding public health responses, and monitoring the effectiveness of interventions to control the spread of the virus

## Problem Statement
This project aims to understand covid 19 trends and provide key analysis in India using powerbi tool.


## Useful Insights

1.Impact and Prevention

Insight demonstrates heavily afflicted states with the COVID 19 virus as well as states that demonstrate prevention through the use of high levels of immunisation. 

2.Total Deceased People's Topography

Insight indicates that the number of fatalities is higher in certain states where the bubble size is larger. 

3.Monthly vaccination data

This insight informs us about the monthly pattern of covid 19 vaccination over the course of the covid era.

4.Year wise recover cases

Here, we compare year-by-year COVID 19 recoveries from various states.

5.Total case tested Yearly and monthly

In this section, we examine total examined cases by year and month to determine the most effective months. 


## Dashboard

1.Index

It is an optimised index page with all three dashboard bookmarks. When we click on a specific bookmark, it will take us to that dashboard.


2.State Wise Dashboard

Summarise way to visualise overall recovery, total recover, and total deceased people in various states.

3.Total Examine Case Dashboard

![App Screenshot](https://github.com/RahulB711/Covid19DataAnalysis/blob/main/Dashboard/India%20test%20wise%20data.png?raw=true)

Summarise way of visualising overall examination cases in various states on a yearly and monthly basis.

4.Total Vaccination Dashboard

Summarise way of visiualising overall vaccination in different states on a yearly and monthly basis.

## Conclusion

UP has the highest number of covid tests (84 million) and vaccinations (131 million).

Maharashtra has the most confirmed cases, with 6.6 million.

Looking at the topography, it is clear that the central and southern parts of India have been hit the worst.

When comparing the years 2020 and 2021, the impact of covid -19 in 2021 has more than doubled in terms of total perished people and somewhat higher in confirmed cases.

In the months of May, June, and July of 2021, the maximum number of covid tests was over 60 million per month.

## Summary and Challanges Faced:

i> Because the powerbi is a new tool for me, this project allows me to learn, practise, and experiment with various features of this tool. 

ii> Because the covid19 dataset was too large and consisted of three different tables, it was necessary to interpret the datasets and extract relevant knowledge.
